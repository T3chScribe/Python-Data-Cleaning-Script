# Python Data Cleaning Script
A python script written to clean data in a csv file. 

Common data cleaning tasks include:
- Removing or filling missing values.
- Removing duplicates.
- Standardizing data formats (e.g., converting strings to lowercase).
- Removing unwanted characters or spaces.

This is a general-purpose Python script that performs some basic cleaning operations on a (theoretical) CSV file called `data.csv`. This script will:
1. Remove rows with missing values.
2. Remove duplicate rows.
3. Standardize string data by converting it to lowercase.

*Requirements*

Make sure to have the `pandas` library installed. You can install it via pip if you haven't done so:

```
bash
pip install panda

```
